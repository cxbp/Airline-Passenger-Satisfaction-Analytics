# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction-Analytics
Airline companies are suffering huge impacts in 2020 due to the COVID-19. How can airlines improve their business after the pandemic? This recently published airline Passenger Satisfaction dataset comes from Kaggle ( https://www.kaggle.com/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction ). It collected information from airline passenger surveys. The data is already splitted into a training set and a testing set on Kaggle. The training set contains 103905 rows, and the test set contains 25977 rows. Both sets have 25 columns. The goal of this project is to attempt various machine learning methods on the datasets, and find out factors that have significant effect on customer satisfaction.
